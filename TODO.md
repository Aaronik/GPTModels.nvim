#### Little Things
* Snacks.picker closes the window on <Esc> from normal mode. Should do same.
* Make sure o1 models are available
* Let some ops, like attach files, work in insert mode as well
* Let <CR> work from all windows
* chat window's prompt needs to be adjusted so the user request counts as much as the included files,
  currently it's dominated by the files and many llms end up just explaining what's in the files
* Get live reloading of C-p telescope model picker when openai results come in
* chat window should auto scroll when opened with autosaved session
* Add copilot support
    * https://github.com/B00TK1D/copilot-api/blob/main/api.py -- python implementation
    * Maybe can just use copilot.nvim if there's an available API
* Figure out how to test nui border text and test all the titles
* Help window
    * with detailed descriptions of commands
    * input bottom border is just q, Enter, and Ctrl-h maybe, or maybe just Ctrl-h
* :help docs
* make target for project wide type check pass
    * https://luals.github.io/wiki/usage/#arguments
    * /opt/homebrew/Cellar/lua-language-server/3.11.1/bin/lua-language-server --checklevel=Warning --logpath=/tmp/lls_out --check lua/gptmodels
    The above prints the lls results into a json file. It does not recognize the neodev configured stuff though, so no vim global is configured, etc.
    and there are >200 errors for the fully working plugin.

* Switch to actual busted for testing, remove plenary if possible
    * Might could leverage lazy.nvim's built-in luarocks package management system
* Is there a way to bring the autocomplete context from one window into another? So if there's some_long_method_name in the code window,
  it'll also be available for autocomplete in the input window?
* Save one session to disk. Sessions are remembered across restarts
* Save results of previous llm fetches to disk too, totally solve fetch slowness.
    * Still need to get real time insert though for the UX
* Should use vim.ui.select instead of calling telescope directly?


#### Big Ideas
* window for project wide patch actions, similar to aider
* window for nvim meta actions? The llm has control of the nvim environment?
