#### Little Things
* chat window should auto scroll when opened with autosaved session
* code needs C-y?
* Focus same buffer on nui exit?
* Add copilot support
    * https://github.com/B00TK1D/copilot-api/blob/main/api.py -- python implementation
* Protect against opening windows many times?
* Figure out how to test nui border text and test all the titles
* Help window
    * with detailed descriptions of commands
    * input bottom border is just q, Enter, and Ctrl-h maybe, or maybe just Ctrl-h
* :help docs
* make target for project wide type check pass
* Switch to actual busted for testing, remove plenary if possible
    * Might could leverage lazy.nvim's built-in luarocks package management system

#### Big Ideas
* window for project wide patch actions, similar to aider
* window for nvim meta actions? The llm has control of the nvim environment?
