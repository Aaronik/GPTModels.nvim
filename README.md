# GPTModels.nvim - a window based AI plugin

![gptmodels_demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19839d07-0282-444a-99f4-cd538a44ca36)

---

This is an iteration on the window features of [jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim](https://github.com/jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim).
It's an AI plugin designed to tighten your neovim workflow with AI LLMs.
It offers two windows: one for chat, and one for code editing.

The plugin is developed with a focus on **stability** and **user experience**.
The plugin code itself is well tested and leverages the lua type system, which makes it more robust.

---

### Features

* **Two popup windows to facilitate AI integration**
* **Works out of the box** - There's no configuration; the plugin is meant to just work.
* **Supports OpenAI and Ollama** - Local LLMs can be amazing as well. This plugin makes it simple to query different models. I often get "second opinions" on code I'm getting LLMs help with.
* **LSP Diagnostic inclusion** - LSP diagnostics in selected code are transferred to the code window for easy diagnostic fixing.
* **File inclusion** - Include files with your request by hitting <C-f> and picking from the telescope picker.
* **Background processing** - Close the window while the AI responds, open the window and the response will continue streaming in the background.
* **Request cancellation** - Cancel requests midflight with Ctrl-c. Save tokens and time.
* **Selection inclusion** - Both windows, when opened with selected text, bring that selected text into the window for inclusion in your llm request. Opening with a selection clears the old session automatically.
* **Filetype inclusion** - The file's extension is included in llm requests so you don't have to specify what kind of code it is or leave the llm to guess.
* **Stability** - This was written test first, and always will be. It also makes heavy use of the lua type system, which makes the code more robust. There will be bugs, but hopefully fewer and less severe.
* **UX in mind** - It's hard to enumerate the little things, but I hope and think you'll notice them as you use the plugin. Examples include keeping sessions across close in both windows, saving the prompt window after you type stuff before you send the request, so you can slowly build up the request, scrolls on llm responses unless you're in the window, so you can interact with the response before it's finished, responsive window resizing when terminal window changes size, and more little things like this.

### Usage

This plugin offers two commands:

<details>
  <summary>:GPTModelsCode -- open a window designed to iterate on selections of code</summary>
  <img width="1271" alt="image of :GPTChat window" src="https://github.com/Aaronik/GPT.nvim/assets/1324601/3e642a48-ce56-4295-a5fa-368b523bab2e">
</details>
<details>
  <summary>:GPTModelsChat -- open a chat window, like ChatGPT</summary>
  <img width="1271" alt="image of :GPTCode window" src="https://github.com/Aaronik/GPT.nvim/assets/1324601/ca6604af-302f-4a44-8964-bb683633031e">
</details>

**The code window** (:GPTModelsCode) is great for iterating on a selection of
code. You have three panes - the left pane holds code you're working on, the
right pane code only responses from the LLMs, and then you have an input for
your prompt. If you call it with a visual selection, that selection will be
placed into the left pane. If your visual selection has LSP diagnostics, they
will be placed into the input pane. From there you can iterate on the prompt
and ultimately the code. Press Ctrl-x to replace the left pane with the
contents of the right, rinse and repeat. In this window, code is the main
focus. I use this whenever I have an AI request to modify some code I'm working
on. The prompt behind the scenes is tuned so the AI only responds with code
(although prompts are hard to get perfect, so be lenient.) Other features,
including changing models and including files, are labeled on the window.

**The chat window** is great for having a free form conversation. You can still open with
a selection, include files, cancel requests, etc.

#### Keymaps

The keymaps work in normal mode within the popup windows.

The keymaps strive to be labaled and easily visible from within the plugin so you don't need to reference
them here. But here they are anyways:

| Keybinding | Action           | Description      |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| `<CR>`     | send request     | pressing enter sends your prompt and any files or code selected to the llm |
| `q`        | quit             | close the window |
| `[S]Tab`   | cycle windows    | switch focus into each window successively |
| `C-c`      | cancel request   | send SIGTERM to the `curl` command making the fetch |
| `C-f`      | add files        | open the file picker window and include file contents in your request |
| `C-g`      | clear files      | clear the files you have selected, leaving the windows be |
| `C-x`      | xfer to deck     | in the code window, transfer the right pane's contents to the left |
| `C-j/k`    | cycle models     | cycle through which LLM model to use for further requests |
| `C-p`      | pick model       | open a popup window to pick a model. Useful when you have many models |
| `C-n`      | clear all        | clear the whole state, all the windows and files |

---

### Installation

This plugin requires `curl` be installed for requests.
For Ollama requests, have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running locally.
To use a remote Ollama server, set `vim.g.gptmodels_ollama_host` to the server's URL (e.g., `http://remote-host:11434`).
For OpenAI requests, have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set.

Now, in your favorite package manager:

lazy:
```lua
{
  "Aaronik/GPTModels.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim"
  }
}
```

Plug:
```vim
Plug "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim"
Plug "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim"
Plug "Aaronik/GPTModels.nvim"
```

_(Contributions to this readme for how to do other package managers are welcome)_

#### Mapping

Here are some examples of how to map these -- this is what I use, `<leader>a` for the code window and `<leader>c` for the chat

in `init.lua`:
```lua
-- Both visual and normal mode for each, so you can open with a visual selection or without.
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('v', '<leader>a', ':GPTModelsCode<CR>', { noremap = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>a', ':GPTModelsCode<CR>', { noremap = true })

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('v', '<leader>c', ':GPTModelsChat<CR>', { noremap = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>c', ':GPTModelsChat<CR>', { noremap = true })
```

in `.vimrc`:
```vim
" Or if you prefer the traditional way
nnoremap <leader>a :GPTModelsCode<CR>
vnoremap <leader>a :GPTModelsCode<CR>

nnoremap <leader>c :GPTModelsChat<CR>
vnoremap <leader>c :GPTModelsChat<CR>
```

### Thanks

Big thanks to [@jackMort](https://github.com/jackMort) for the inspiration for the code window. I used [jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim](https://github.com/jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim) for a long time before deciding to write this plugin.
